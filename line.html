			<p>Hi, I am Ryan! I love ice cream because each of us has a wonderful, happy memory about it. To me, ice cream is how I celebrate love and togetherness. As a young boy, my dad often had to miss our family dinners to work extra hours. But as my sister and I were getting ready for bed, Dad would arrive home and call to us </p>
